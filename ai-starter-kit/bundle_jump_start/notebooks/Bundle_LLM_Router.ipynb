    "The SambaNova Bundle (Composition of Experts) LLM Router is a flexible system designed to route queries to the most appropriate expert model based on the content of the query. This notebook will guide you through the process of using the Bundle LLM router, explaining its customizable nature, different modes of operation, and how to effectively utilize them."

    "## Understanding the Bundle LLM Router\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bundle LLM Router uses a customizable approach to classify incoming queries into different categories. Each category corresponds to a specific expert model that is best suited to handle queries in that domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Customizable Categories\n",
    "\n",
    "Users can define their own categories based on their specific needs. Here are some example categories that could be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Finance\n",
    "- Economics\n",
    "- Mathematics\n",
    "- Code Generation\n",
    "- Legal\n",
    "- Medical\n",
    "- History\n",
    "- Turkish Language\n",
    "- Japanese Language\n",
    "- Literature\n",
    "- Physics\n",
    "- Chemistry\n",
    "- Biology\n",
    "- Psychology\n",
    "- Sociology\n",
    "- Generalist (for queries not fitting into specific categories)\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, these are just examples. You can define your own categories based on your specific use case and the expert models you have available."

    "## The Importance of Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "The effectiveness of the Bundle LLM Router heavily depends on the quality and structure of the prompts used. A well-crafted prompt ensures that the router accurately classifies the query and directs it to the appropriate expert model. When designing your prompt, consider including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A clear instruction to classify the message into one of your predefined categories.\n",
    "2. Examples of queries for each category to provide context.\n",
    "3. Any specific rules or considerations for classification.\n",
    "4. A request for the model to explain its classification decision.\n",
    "\n",
