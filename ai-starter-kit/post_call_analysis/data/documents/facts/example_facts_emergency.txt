1.1 CPR
Giving CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation) is a crucial skill that can potentially save someone's life in an emergency situation. Here's a detailed guide on how to give CPR:
Assess the Scene: Before approaching the person, ensure that the area is safe for both you and the victim. Look for any potential dangers such as traffic, fire, or electrical hazards.
Check Responsiveness: Gently shake the person and shout, "Are you okay?" Check for any signs of responsiveness such as movement, breathing, or vocalization. If there is no response, assume the person is unconscious and proceed with CPR.
Call for Help: If you're alone, call emergency services (911 or the local emergency number) immediately before starting CPR. If someone else is present, instruct them to call while you begin CPR.
Position the Person: Lay the person on their back on a flat, firm surface. Ensure their airway is clear by tilting their head back slightly and lifting their chin.
Check for Breathing: Look, listen, and feel for any signs of normal breathing for no more than 10 seconds. Place your ear near their mouth, look for chest rise, and feel for breath on your cheek.
Start Chest Compressions: If the person is not breathing or only gasping, begin chest compressions. Place the heel of one hand on the center of the person's chest, between the nipples. Place your other hand on top of the first hand and interlock your fingers. Keep your arms straight and position your shoulders directly over your hands.
Perform Compressions: Press down on the chest firmly and quickly, allowing it to rise completely between compressions. Compress the chest at least 2 inches (5 centimeters) deep and at a rate of 100 to 120 compressions per minute. Allow the chest to fully recoil between compressions.
Give Rescue Breaths: After 30 compressions, open the person's airway using the head-tilt, chin-lift technique. Pinch the person's nose shut and give two rescue breaths into their mouth, making sure to see the chest rise with each breath. Each breath should last about 1 second.
Continue CPR: Alternate between 30 chest compressions and 2 rescue breaths. Continue CPR until emergency medical personnel arrive, the person shows signs of life, or you are too exhausted to continue.
Use an AED (if available): If an automated external defibrillator (AED) is available, follow the device's prompts to use it. Apply the pads to the person's bare chest as instructed and follow the AED's voice or visual prompts.
Remember, CPR is a lifesaving technique, but it's essential to seek professional medical help as soon as possible. Regular training in CPR techniques and staying up-to-date with CPR guidelines can help you respond effectively in emergency situations.
